## Project: Rock–Paper–Scissors Game in Python

---

##  SOFTWARE CONCEPT AND OVERVIEW

**What is the Project?**

The Rock–Paper–Scissors program is a small Python-based interactive game that allows a user to play against the computer.  

<br>
Main game loop:

Initializes a scoreboard dictionary to track wins, losses, and ties.

Sets cheat_mode flag to False initially.

Repeatedly prompts user for input (rock, paper, scissors, quit, or predictor).

If user enters "quit", game ends and final scoreboard prints.

If user enters "predictor", cheat mode is enabled (computer will lose intentionally).

Validates input; if invalid, asks again.

Adds countdown printouts (Rock..., Paper..., Scissors..., Shoot!) with half-second delays.

Gets computer choice via get_computer_choice.

Prints computer's choice.

Uses determine_winner to find round outcome.

Updates scoreboard counts accordingly.

Prints encouraging or neutral messages depending on result.

Prints updated scoreboard and some trivia about rock-paper-scissors.

Continues until user quits.
